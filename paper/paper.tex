\begin{abstract}

With Crowdsourcing transforming to the web, a new field rises. \cite{cswww}
Still, the prime examples of the Crowdsourcing (CS) paradigm are Wikipedia, 
Linux, Yahoo! Answers and Mechanical Turk-based systems.

Crowdsourcing Systems are on the rise, yet defining Crowdsourcing systems turns out to be
surprisingly tricky \cite{cswww}.

This article will give some insight on what is state of the art on Crowdsourcing Systems and
what we can expect of them in the future.

Crowdsourcing - Instead of using lots of computational power to solve complex tasks, let a multitude of humans solve these (for humans often easy) problems.


\section{Introduction}

\section{State of the Art}

To analyse the state of the art of Crowdsourcing, a good start is looking at some existing Crowdsourcing systems.
There is a wide variety of them, also aiming in totally different directions.

\subsection{Challenges}

According to \cite{r02} there are 4 main challenges in Crowdsourcing at Finpro, a foresight company. We believe, these
main challenges also apply to Crowdsourcing in General:

\paragraph{Motivation}
Motivation is the main challenge in Crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing must be rewarding and appreciated. If platforms
are not designed to motivate workers, resistance or rejection might happen. Crowdsourcing platforms should be prepared
for those reactions and should have countermeasures in mind.

\paragraph{User Interface Simplicity}
It might be obvious, but it is fundamental: If the platform is too complex, not easy or simply not attractive, nobody will use it.
Much time should be investigated to design a simple and attractive user interface.

\paragraph{Training}
In order to obtain good results, you want good workers. Training them might come in handy. Train them to understand the type of 
tasks they have to solve and encourage them to use the features your platform provides. This especially applies if your tasks are not
trivial, but complex and time consuming.

\paragraph{Feedback}
The last important challenge is to provide feedback. Payment should not be the only reward for workers. Feedback is important.
Let them know about the quality of their work or they probably will not be doing it for long.


\subsection{Example Platforms}

A very straight forward example is http://crowdflower.com/ .
They advertise with: 'There's No Limit to What CrowdFlower Can Do - Just Ask Our Customers'.
CrowdFlower provide a platform to submit any work, which will be tackled by 5 million skilled contributors from all around the world.
According to them, there are no limitations to the jobs, from simple to the most complex jobs.

Experts will help you in setting up your project, help you with the pricing and finding a suitable workflow for your project.

Another interesting example is http://www.freelancer.com/contest/ .
If you want something implemented, request your idea as a contest. You also set a reward / a price for freelancers (basically developers) to complete this task.
And here exactly the idea of crowdsourcing applies: Human workers will solve the task for you, in different quality of course. You can then choose
from the solutions and award the best entry, provide feedback to the developers and finally starting a handover process to legally own that entry.

This already shows the possibilities of Crowdsourcing. It is by no means limited to small tasks or a small mass of human workers.
Everyone can register as freelancer and participate in the contest, and the task also does not have to be trivial for humans, but can also be complex.



\section{Future}

What can we expect from future Crowdsourcing platforms?
